		<div class="accordion content">
			<p>Hi, I'm Emily and this website is all about ME!</p>
			<p>I currently live in North London but am about to move back to my hometown of Northampton. 
			<p>I'm a mother of two gorgeous boys aged 3 and 1.</p>
			<p>I love learning, and have taught myself things like baking, chocolate-making, and now coding (which I'm finding utterly addictive!)</p>
		</div>
	<h3 class="accordion">Why I want to learn to code</h3>
		<div class="accordion content">
			<p>Whilst I love being a mum I want to start a career.</p>
			<p>Having originally studied Philosophy and read an MA in Human Rights, I went on to do a Law Conversion Course with a view to beocming a Barrister in Public Law. I took my law exams whilst my eldest son was 3 months old, this was one of the hardest things I've ever done and involved studying during his naps and late into the night. My hard work paid off and I received a distinction.</p>
			<p>I then worked as a volunteer in a Law Centre. I loved this work, especially the problem-solving it required, but it became increasingly apparent to me that the work I wanted to do was not going to be conducive with my family-life. I therefore had a rethink...</p>
			<p>a long, hard, think</p>
			<p>...before it hit me! My perfect career choice - <span>CODING!</span></p>
